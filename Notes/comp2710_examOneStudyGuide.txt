- Defintions
	- 90/10 rule: 10% of your program will take you 90% of the processor time to run
	- Procedural: Implement algorithms via functions (variables, functions, etc.)
	- Modular: Partition program into modules (separate compilation)
	- Object-oriented: Divide program into classes (data hiding, inheritance)
		- Encapsulation: "Black box" - internal data hidden
		- Inheritance: Related classes share implementation and/or interface
		- Polymorphism: Ability to use a class without knowing its type
	- Generic: Manipulate arbitrary data types (STL: containers, algorithms)
	- Variable: Named memory location
		- Variable value: Data stored in variable
		- Compiler removes variable name and assigns memory location
	- Assignment statement: Order to the computer to sets left value to right
		- Ex: numberOfBars = 37;
	- Stream: A sequence of data to be processed
		- Input stream: Data to be input into program
		- Output stream: Data generated by the program to be output
	- Flow control: Order in which statements are executed
		- Sequence control: One after the other
		- Selection control (if-else)
			- Ternary conditional operator (?)
		- Case control (switch): Useful when variable is tested for multiple values
			- Consists of a series of case labels and an optional default case 
			- Break is necessary
			- Ex: 	switch (char) {
					case'N': cout < "New York\n";
						break;
					default: cout < "Somewhere else\n";
						break;
				}
		- Repetition control (loops):
	- Pointer: A variable whose value is the address of another variable
		- Add * before variable name to derefence it
	- Unit: Smallest testable part of an application
		- Procedural programming unit: An individual function or procedure
		- Object-oriented programming unit: An interface such as a class
- Why C++?
	- Stable, compatible, scalable
- Showing decimal places
	- To specify fixed point notation: cout.setf(ios::fixed);
	- To specify that the decimal point will always be shown: cout.setf(ios::showpoint);
	- To specify that two decimal places will always be shown: cout.precision(2);
- Pointer declaration
	- With an asertix before each variable in the expression, it sets the first one to the value of the second
		- Otherwise, it just maps the first one to the address of the second
	- With an & symbol before the second variable, it sets the first one to the address of the second variable
	- Ex: 	int *p1, *p2, v1, v2;
		p1 = &v1;
		(Sets pointer variable p1 to "point to" int variable v1)
- References and pointers
	- In functions, there are 3 ways to pass arguments
		- Call-by-value
		- Call-by-reference with pointer argument
		- Call-by-reference with reference argument
